# Streaming With NodeJS & React 
This is the code repoitroy for [this](https://youtu.be/MUPoihJTOm8) tutorial which explains how to stream audio and video files from a NodeJS server to a React client. There are 2 main sections `client` which is where the React project is stored and `server` which holds the NodeJS server.

When you download this you will need to run `npm install` in both directories to install the modules and then run `npm run dev` to run both the server and client in development mode.

Since `server/src/assets/video.mp4` exceeds the github file size limit I have linked it [here](https://www.pexels.com/video/light-sea-city-streets-26492049/) for you to download and experiment with.
